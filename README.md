# SMART
**[SMART](http://www.dmi.unict.it/~faro/smart/index.php) (String Matching Algorithm Research Tool)** is a tool which provides a standard framework for researchers in string matching. It helps users to test, design, evaluate and understand existing solutions for the exact string matching problem. Moreover it provides the implementation of (almost) all string matching algorithms and a wide corpus of text buffers.

## [Download SMART](https://github.com/smart-tool/smart/releases)
The release of smart will be available [here](https://github.com/smart-tool/smart/releases)

## How to compile it from source
To compile the source just download (or clone) this repository and run the file makefile from terminal (with **./makefile**), it will compile the smart binaries and all the algorithms (the algorithms binaries will be created into source/bin/).
